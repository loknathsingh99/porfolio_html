                            high performance website is always a sign of mine.

                            depressed, I failed in 2-3 interviews and I was not able to face the interviews.
                            Then we met him and, he politely answered all my and my friend's doubts and issues.

                            I was in dire need of his support so I went to meet him, he asked me to take 20 minutes
                            every day at a fixed time and study daily at that time, without any excuses, be it the end
                            of the world, no matter the circumstances, and to send a picture as proof of work.

                            Then, I honestly started, and because of that 20-minutes task that continued for 2 months, I
                            was able to revise all the programming concepts. That 20-minute task changed my life, I
                            achieved a new level of confidence and cracked placement in 4 to 5 companies.
                            This all happened because of him and I am at a very satisfactory package.

                            I would like to suggest that those who want to ask him for his help, please be sure of being
                            honest about your goals, because he really put his valuable time and effort into the

                        consistency", and there's a lot to say in his positives but the more I say the less it is for

                            It was the time when everyone was so tense about placement including me because the final
                            year was going on then one hand came which showed the path and the confidence that yes
                            everything is possible and I can also achieve whatever I want, that hand was of none other
                            than "Loknath Singh".
